Week 2 overview
----------------

Welcome to the second week of the "How to Win a Data Science Competition" course! Here is a short summary of what you will learn.

Dmitry Ulyanov  will start this week with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It is a very broad and exciting topic and an essential component of solving process. Besides regular videos you will find a walk through EDA process for Springleaf competition data and an example of elegant EDA for NumerAI competition with extraordinary findings.
Alexander Guschin will discuss validation. We will see that the validation design depends on the competition setup and that correct validation scheme is one of the essential bricks for any winning solution. Here, we will analyze how data in a competition can be split into train and test, and review most frequent validation problems.
Dmitry Altukhov  will cover the topic which is very unique to data science competitions - data leakages. That is, we will see how it is sometimes possible to get a top position in a competition with a very little machine learning, just by exploiting a data leakage. You will need to complete a peer-reviewed programming assignment, where you will get >99% test accuracy without using train set and machine learning at all.
To keep up the work you've started on the final project in the previous week, we recommend you to apply ideas we will discuss and set up baseline upon which you will build up the rest of your solution. Basically, you should analyze your dataset, set up the validation and check the data for leakages.

Now, let's go ahead and get started!
